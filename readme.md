# Two-round symetric encryption in C#

## Instructions and notes:

All of the source code is contained in a single file - `Program.cs`

## To execute on Linux:

1. Install `dotnet core`
   2. Build and run the program with the command [dotnet run]
    

## Program notes:
    
A single program is used for both encryption and decryption. When the program starts you will select the mode of operation and then enter either the plain text or cipher text of the left and right word. You must enter these values as an 8-bit hexadecimal number. Do not use the '0x' prefix. The program will then perform the selected operation and display the results. If the third mode of "Both Encrypt and Decrypt" is selected, the plain text will be encrypted and then immediately decrypted, return the original value.
